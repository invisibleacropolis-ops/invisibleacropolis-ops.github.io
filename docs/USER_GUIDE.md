## First-person navigation

- **Click the scene** to capture the mouse and enable pointer lock.
- **Move** with `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` (arrow keys also work).
- **Look around** with the mouse.
- **Press `Esc`** to release the mouse cursor.

The camera automatically rides above the terrain height so you stay above the ground as you walk.
